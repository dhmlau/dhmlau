## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineering manager at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/), managing the development effort for API Connect on [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/10_reserved_instance) and [AWS](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/saas). I love learning different technologies. You can see some of my tutorials on [Medium](https://mobilediana.medium.com/).

Besides, I'm also part of the Technical Steering Committe for [LoopBack](https://loopback.io), a highly extensible Node.js and TypeScript framework for building APIs and microservices.
